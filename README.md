### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D student at Florida State University, where I work with the [xs/fs experimental lab.](https://coss.fsu.edu/xsfs/#:~:text=About%20xs%2Ffs,topics%20in%20the%20Social%20Sciences.)

My research is focused on political behavior, specifically on indentity and redistribution based voting behavior and coalition building. A particular application of this literature that I am interested in is social production goods such as open-source software, wikis, public guides and so on.

For my research, I use methods from behavioral and experimental economics, social choice theory, attribution, game theory, and machine learning.
