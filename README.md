### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D student at The University of Rochester. Previously, I was affiliated with Florida State University, where I worked with the [xs/fs experimental lab.](https://coss.fsu.edu/xsfs/#:~:text=About%20xs%2Ffs,topics%20in%20the%20Social%20Sciences.)

My research is focused on political behavior, specifically voting behavior, distributive politics, and gender. 

I use methods from behavioral and experimental economics, rational choice theories, attribution, game theory, and text analysis. I am specifically interested bringing technical methods such as experiments, web scraping, formal theory, and text analysis to the next generation of political science through robust and inclusive instruction.
