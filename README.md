### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D student at Florida State University, where I work with the [xs/fs experimental lab.](https://coss.fsu.edu/xsfs/#:~:text=About%20xs%2Ffs,topics%20in%20the%20Social%20Sciences.)

My research is focused on political behavior, specifically on identity and redistribution based voting behavior and coalition building. 

For my research, I use methods from behavioral and experimental economics, social choice theory, attribution, game theory, and machine learning. I am specifically interested bringing technical methods such as experiments, machine learning, and text analysis to the next generation of political science through robust and inclusive instruction.
